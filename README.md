# Portfolio V2 

![Portfolio website demo](./src/images/demo.gif)

This is my portfolio website that I built using Gatsby & React. I refactored it from [V1](www.github.com/angieloux/portfolio-v1) which was just a basic HTML/CSS static site that I built last year as my first 'coding' project.

This site makes use of a Gatsby starter, dynamic images, hooks, effects and animations to display my most recent web dev projects in a minimalistic but effective way. 

## **Tools used**
- Gatsby
- JavaScript
- React
- Bootstrap
- HTML/CSS/SASS
- Deployed on Netlify

## *COMING SOON:*

ðŸŒ±A digital garden. It will be featuring thought/inspiration nodes from my writing in [Remnote](https://www.remnote.com/) & [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) over the past few years.
